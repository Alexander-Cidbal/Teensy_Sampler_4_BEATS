## 📖 About

This project was born out of three of my great passions: beatmaking, electronics, and design. Currently, there are many hardware alternatives that serve similar purposes, but almost none of them are open source, so this project aims to achieve the following:

- **Opensource:** CCode and schematics available for anyone to experiment with, modify, and reinvent their own machine.
- **Budget friendly:** I tried to use components that could be found in any electronics store (except for the Teensy board, which I bought at Sparkfun, although they are also available on Aliexpress for a similar price). The casing can be any plastic container, as long as you know how to cut and make holes.
- **Expandible:** Any modifications are welcome, and I would appreciate any feedback from the beatmaking, electronics, DIY makers, etc. community. Visit the community section and, coming soon, the Discord server.

## Features
### Hardware
- **16 Buttons** for finger drumming and live performance. I used key switches, because I like the clicky sensation they give. 
- **8 Potentiometers** For controlling effects, volumes, values, etc. 
- **4 Encoders** For ADSR control, navigation, individual control values, etc
- **3 Joysticks** Why not make it fun and expressive? You can map values to the X and Y axes of each one. Try manipulating effects while playing live!
- **9 Control buttons** System control. Actions like "Save", "Open", "Undo", "Quantize", etc. Shortcuts included.
