## 📖 About

This project was born out of three of my great passions: **beatmaking, electronics, and design**. 

Currently, there are many hardware alternatives that serve similar purposes (like the SP-404 or MPCs), but almost none of them are truly open source. This project aims to bridge that gap with the following philosophy:

- **Open Source:** Code and schematics are available for anyone to experiment with, modify, and reinvent their own machine.
- **Budget Friendly:** Designed using components easily found in standard electronics stores (except for the Teensy board, available at Sparkfun or similar distributors).
- **DIY Enclosure:** The casing is designed to be adaptable. You can use any plastic container or 3D print your own, as long as you have the tools for cutting and drilling.
- **Expandable:** Modifications are welcome! I highly value feedback from the beatmaking, electronics, and maker communities.

## 🛠 Technologies

I am using the following technologies and libraries. Big thanks to their creators and maintainers:

* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/) - Main development environment.
* [Teensy Audio Library](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Audio.html) - The core engine for audio processing.
* **KiCad** - Used for schematic capture and PCB design.

## 🎛 Features

### Hardware
- **16 Mechanical Switches:** Used for finger drumming and live performance. I chose mechanical key switches (Cherry MX style) for that tactile clicky sensation and durability.
- **8 Potentiometers:** For real-time control of effects, volume, and parameters.
- **4 Encoders:** Endless rotary encoders for ADSR control, menu navigation, and fine-tuning values.
- **3 Joysticks:** Why not make it fun and expressive? Map values to X/Y axes to manipulate effects while playing live.
- **9 Function Buttons:** System controls including "Save", "Open", "Undo", "Quantize", and Shift shortcuts.

### Software (Planned)
- **Sample Playback:** Low latency triggering from SD card.
- **Sequencer:** Step sequencer and live recording.
- **Effects:** Reverb, Delay, and Bitcrusher implementation.

## 🚀 Instructions

### **Assembly and Wiring**
> 🚧 **Work in Progress:** Detailed wiring diagrams and assembly guide coming soon. 
### You can view the current schematics [HERE](https://i.imgur.com/9fgKyoE.png).

The interactive wiring diagram is hosted on Cirkit Designer. Since GitHub doesn't allow interactive embeds, **click the image below to open the interactive viewer**: <a href="https://app.cirkitdesigner.com/project/12ed71a3-bdbf-4b91-8f72-1112bf8fde8e?view=interactive_preview" target="_blank"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9fgKyoE.png" alt="Interactive Wiring Diagram" width="100%"> </a> <p align="center">   <a href="https://app.cirkitdesigner.com/project/12ed71a3-bdbf-4b91-8f72-1112bf8fde8e" target="_blank"></a></p>

### **Flashing the Firmware**

1. Clone the repository:
```bash 
git clone [https://github.com/tu-usuario/tu-proyecto.git](https://github.com/tu-usuario/tu-proyecto.git)
```
2.   Open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE.
    
3.  Select **Teensy 4.1** from the board manager.
    
4.   Compile and Upload.
